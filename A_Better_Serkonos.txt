When I first met with my inner circle, I saw nervous faces. Even the boldest were afraid, wondering if we'd live to see another Feast. Now Serkonos is ascendant.
But this is a story that began long years before. I knew Delilah when I was only a boy. And even after she was lost, dead, and gone from the world, her memory burned in my mind. Until finally I began to hear her whispering, calling to me from the Void. Telling her story of growing up in Dunwall Tower, and the half-sister who cheated her of her throne.
Then she told me there was a way to bring her home.
Delilah. Beautiful, immortal.
