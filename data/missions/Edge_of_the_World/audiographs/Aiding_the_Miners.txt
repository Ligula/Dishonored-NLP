I spend less and less time here at my apartment, but my work at Addermire demands it. After the horrible failures of my first serum, I'm more determined than ever to help the miners.
It's not my say, how hard the Duke and his cronies drive the workers, but until he sees reason, I'll do what I can to make their lives better, and to provide comfort to their families.
It's my obsession, this work and the impact it'll have on the least privileged people in Karnaca. Studying the original plague  elixirs, I'm close to something.
