Elmira, Elmira, please come home, Elmira
She left one day to work the clay, but never did come back this way
They say she found a silver vein, longer than the Empire's reign
Running deep the miner's way, looking for the light of day
Elmira, Elmira, please come home Elmira!
She's down there still, and always will, but be my sweet Elmira
Elmira, Elmira, please come home, Elmira
She's caught down in the deepest deeps, never eats and never sleeps
They say she sometimes calls my name, or that by now she's gone insane
Elmira, Elmira, please come home, Elmira
She's down there still, and always will, be my sweet Elmira
