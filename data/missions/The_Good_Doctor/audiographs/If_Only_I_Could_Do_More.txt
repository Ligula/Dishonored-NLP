The blackouts are worse, and my dreams have taken a turn toward the disturbing. Even rest eludes me.
Duke Abele seemed overprotective at first, but increasingly I'm a prisoner in my own lab. The soldiers stationed here leave me alone, but even then I feel like I'm being watched.
What really saddens me is the loss of my work. I've always thrived on my connection to the people who need me the most. The workers and their families.
Each time I hear there's been an outbreak of some fever, or new condition among the miners, it pains me that I am not with them, working to ease their suffering.
