A Complete Listing of Symptoms due to the Inhalation of Airborne Debris
Any of the following symptoms can be observed after sustained exposure to mining dust, alone or in combination:
Coughing, Sneezing, Neck Complaints, Necrosis of the Eye, Insidious Deficiency, Pleurisy, Lung Purge, Miners Ear, Black Spittle, Black Vomit, Confusion, Pneumonia, Lack of Appetite, Excessive Appetite, Tremors, Bartholomew's Rigor, Apoplexy, Death.
Should any of these be present, as a prescription I recommend a full Change of Air, followed by a month of leisure along the coast. Use suction to remove dusts and debris from the nose and ears. Apply boiled onions and flax to the chest. These remedies should bring some relief, especially when used in conjunction.
