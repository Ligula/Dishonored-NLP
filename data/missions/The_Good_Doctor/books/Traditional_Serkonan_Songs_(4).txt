The Calling of the Endless Sea
On the furthest reaching pier, I was abandoned
As the vessel fled the port
Leaving me with only warm winds
Looking upon the foamy wake of regret
The undulating dancers
And the taste of Tyvian wine
Couldn't overcome my recollection of the Ocean
And its swaying whispers
Even now the excited cries of my homecoming children
Leave me unmoved and weary
Longing for the lament of the deep ones
And their inscrutable mysteries
I carve through the umberwood forests
And I bleed the mountain's silver veins
Yet no purse overflowing with coins
Pays enough to slake my thirst for the salty depths
I'm no aristocrat or Lord,
No Overseer or well-versed scholar
But I'd burn all their tomes
And melt down their precious crowns
To be young again and back on the endless sea
