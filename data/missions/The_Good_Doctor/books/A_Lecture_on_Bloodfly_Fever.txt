TRANSCRIPT OF A LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY BY DOCTOR ALEXANDRIA HYPATIA:
Direct Attention to Chart 7
Here you have the final stage of the bloodfly infection. This patient is 37 years of age, and was a school headmistress before her unfortunate encounter with a large nest in her deceased uncle’s greenhouse. Note the lesions on her face and arms, and the larval swellings throughout the body.
But what the drawings cannot show you is her demeanor before death; the most striking symptom of progressed infection is the protective attitude demonstrated towards the nest. This tells us, even prior to autopsy, that larvae, or their byproducts, have infected the intention center of the victim’s brain.
Direct Attention to Silvergraph Image 4
There is no cure once the condition has advanced this far, though you can make your patient less agitated with a generous dosing of opiates. The subject died three days after this silvergraph was taken.
Direct Attention to Chart 8
And here is the fully mature insect, after its post-bloodfly transformation. Now in beetle form, note it has dropped its wings. It is no longer aggressive, and has many beneficial qualities – especially in the field of agriculture. Without these insects many crops across Serkonos would suffer, leading to loss of yield and a marked reduction in profits.
