- I must ask Captain Ramirez if the Grand Palace answered my letter. Improving the Addermire Solution formula is a priority, but I want to get back to my patients, who need me. Did I even give the captain my letter? Maybe I'll write another. It can't hurt.
- If I find time, I'll prepare a dose of woodwort powder for Lieutenant Valiente, who came to me spouting some strange theory. I doubt he's slept in a week. Severe anxiety and paranoia. Might be a danger to himself or to others.
- I've had new complaints about poor old Hamilton. Apparently, he spends his nights wandering in the Institute, mumbling about horrible things only he can see. He must miss the days when we were actually helping people here, as I do. In any case, our loyal janitor wouldn't hurt a fly.
Everyone is on edge these days. I wish I could discuss all this with Vasco, but I haven't seen him in weeks. Is he avoiding me? I hope I didn't hurt his feelings when I told him I needed room to breathe.
