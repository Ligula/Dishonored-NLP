Breanna Ashworth, curator of the Royal Conservatory. For a while I've believed Ashworth has some connection to the occult in Karnaca.
Something is happening that I don't understand. The Overseers are the forward face of the Abbey, but equally important are our sisters from the Oracular Order.
To be direct, I suspect something is wrong within their sect.
Subtle changes to the types of proclamations they've been making; small but troubling deviations from tradition. But publicly saying anything along these lines will get me accused of heresy by my rivals in the Abbey.
Is it possible that Ashworth has infiltrated the Oracular Order?
