I meant nothing to my fine family beyond an advantageous marriage and years of childbearing.
They promised me to a man three times my age, who wheezed on about our wedding night. But a curious thing happened on the way to the altar.
Delilah.
From the first time I slipped out of the manor in the dead of night, there was no returning to my cage. Looking at the stars and drinking wine on a rooftop, I was free.
Instead of seeing the Overseers for marriage, I visited my father's banker, and raced away from my old life, toward Delilah. Those were the coven's glory days.
