I saw a young woman digging near the Royal Conservatory. I thought she must've lost something so I approached to help. But as I got close I could see she was burying someone recently dead. Before she looked up from her exertions, I ran.
So many things are odd lately. An owl nailed to a door on my way to market. Dead, but I felt it was watching me. Who would do such a thing?
A woman with strange eyes entered my shop and wanted to buy elixir, but as trade she offered me a jar of slugs! I told her no, but she argued. Said they were raised only on dog's blood, as if that made them more valuable. Sinister was her look when I asked her to leave!
What will become of me in this city?
