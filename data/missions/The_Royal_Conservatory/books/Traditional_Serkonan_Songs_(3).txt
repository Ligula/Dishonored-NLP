The King in the Month of Ice
After sparrows three times call,
After gull does three times fall,
Come maiden, mistress, mouse and hen,
Come fisher, farmer, frog and wren.
Once a king dressed in red,
Warmed by flames on feather bed,
While all the town starving cried,
Chilled by winds, the Month of Ice.
Eat them of frost, eat them of snow,
The monarch decreed to them below,
Upon a spike they perched his head,
Cursed his name, burned his stead.
Hush-a-bye, and don't be affright,
Mama will sing through all the night,
Many an hour before morning sun,
Don't dream of horror yet to come.
