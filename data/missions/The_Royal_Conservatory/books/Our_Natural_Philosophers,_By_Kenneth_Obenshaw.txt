"There is always a cure! The question is - what are you willing to sacrifice to have it?"
When Anton Sokolov spoke those words, Gristol was battling the worst plague in a century. Hospitals were overwhelmed, and the citizens panicked. Eventually a cure was found, thanks to the work of Sokolov and Piero Joplin. But that cure came at a terrible price!
In his quest for a remedy, Sokolov needed infected individuals, who were rounded up and given experimental serums so their reactions might be observed. The plague was horrific enough, but these serums brought on dire symptoms of their own! Blood became as if stone in one patient. In another, bone dissolved beneath the skin. The dreadful cries, it is said, were enough to drive a sane person mad. Still, progress was made, according to Sokolov.
Alas, it was not enough to test only the sick! For reasons perhaps only a Natural Philosopher might understand, it was also essential to administer these serums to healthy individuals. Citizens jailed for petty crimes were thrown into cells and injected with Sokolov's experimental serums! Most of these formerly healthy persons perished, of course. Officially, they were all "victims of the plague," sacrificed for a cure and buried in communal graves.
