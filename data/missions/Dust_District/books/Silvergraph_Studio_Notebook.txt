Look- all that matters is that every wedding silvergraph delivery comes with a nice little message. I know they're tacky, but it's what our customers want! We're not here to be poets, stinking of wine and piss, starving in the gutter outside the Crone's Hands.
Here are some examples. Do your best.
We met in the Month of High Cold,
Now we'll hold hands until we're old.
Wed the Month of Rain
A love without refrain.
Wed the Month of Timber,
Ever a day to remember.
Married in the Month of Seeds,
A sweet huckleberry for all your needs.
Wed together in the Month of Cold,
You can dump him when he gets old.
