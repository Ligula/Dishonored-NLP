Beware a strange sound, like the clanking of a factory machine. You might be seconds from an encounter with the latest work of our Grand Inventor, Kirin Jindosh.
And what should we think of these new marvels of industry, coveted by the wealthiest members of Karnacan society and standing vigil over their estates?
I will tell you! These Clockwork Soldiers are a danger to us all, taking lives with all the morality of a shopkeeper's adding machine! They fight for days without rest, as long as the whale oil tanks hidden in their backs don't run dry.
Tyranny awaits unless we act now and re-establish the lawful society established by the former Duke of Serkonos, twice the leader his indolent, irresponsible son has proven to be. Citizens of Karnaca, fight to get these clankers off our streets!
