Anton Sokolov, once the Royal Physician and Head of the the Academy of Natural Philosophy. In your prime, the most sought-after painter in all the Empire. My hero in younger days, now my puppet.

If you're going to use this inelegant-looking device against me, get on with it, Jindosh. Though I'm not sure what you hope to accomplish. I must admit to feeling a bit of professional curiosity as to the function of the apparatus.
Kirin Jindosh
Patience, friend, patience. The sequence of events is important. You'll come to understand my electroshock machine, but when? Before or after that light leaves your eyes? And where does it go when it disappears? Who will tell me that?
Anton Sokolov
Has anyone ever loved the sound of his own voice as much as you do, Kirin? Perhaps the device could tell us that?
Kirin Jindosh
No, sadly, it cannot. But what it can do is take from you the thing you love the most. Your precious intellect. If you won't agree to collaborate on the next clockwork prototype, I'll use the device on that brain of yours, Sokolov. 
Anton Sokolov
I refuse. If I'm to be a drooling idiot, at least I won't be bothered by any more of your rambling theories.
