Jenny
Marykate, what's this then?
Marykate
Did you grow up in the country, dear? Out in the sticks? It's an audiograph machine.
Jenny
But what's it for?
Marykate
It enables important people to record their voices. A prince's order for war, a matron's business instructions, or a lover's hungry words dripping with honey. Even the final thoughts of one lost in despair before jumping off a bridge.
Jenny
So now my voice will live on, even after I'm dead and gone.
