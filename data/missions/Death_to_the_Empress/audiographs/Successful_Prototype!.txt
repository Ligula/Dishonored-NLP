It worked! I painted the Chapel, but added a tree to the painting. After arranging the runes around the chair, both pure and corrupted, I was able to transpose the chapel made of paint with the one made of stone. With more runes, I should be able to do the same to all the empire. This will be my greatest undertaking, transposing my painting - The World As It Should Be - with this wretched dung heap we're all born into. At last, all will be made proper and good.
