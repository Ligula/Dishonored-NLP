No one will ever know exactly what it took to save Emily Kaldwin from a living death as Delilah's puppet. 
No one except the Outsider, who watches everything, and thinks his own dark thoughts, and speaks to few in any generation.
I've learned that our choices always matter to someone, somewhere. And sooner or later, in ways we can't always fathom, the consequences come back to us.
I came from Serkonos to Dunwall as a boy. Made my living as a killer; one of the few who've heard the Outsider's voice. I murdered an Empress, but saved her daughter, who will one day rule the Empire. Those were my choices. I'm ready for what comes.
