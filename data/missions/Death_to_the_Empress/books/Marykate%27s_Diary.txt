The High and Mighty Overseer himself was here when Delilah took the throne.
The look on his face as she vanquished Emily the False and her Serkonan father will forever keep a candle flame flickering in my heart. Watching him beat a frantic retreat, knowing he'd return with others of his bloviating sect; knowing they would fall before us. It was delicious.
The Tower is ours now. Dunwall and Karnaca are ours. Soon too the Oracular Sisters, and when my mistress finishes her painting, we will own all the Empire.
