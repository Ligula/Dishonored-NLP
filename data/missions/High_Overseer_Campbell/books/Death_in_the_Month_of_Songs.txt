[Excerpt from a longer work, translated from old Serkonan - By Anisa Mateo of Serkonos]
She was shy in the Month of Hearths
Hiding from my scented letters
A sun-dappled cure for my loneliness
She was smiling in the Month of Rain
Eating figs straight from the tree
A dream of sailing around the Isles
She was wed in the Month of Clans
To her sailor cousin from Cullero
A shrill bird, drilling at my chest
She was dying in the Month of Songs
Struck by a disease from the East
A terrible kiss on her distant lips
