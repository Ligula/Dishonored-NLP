This whole setup is a huge pain in the ass. Timing windows that ignore the tides, fake boat manifests, and private door codes. It might be easier just to play it straight, pick up and deliver the goods. Anyway, so I don't forget it, the code for the black market shop is Serkonan Wine is Better Than Tyvian Prisons. Idiots.
