Stinging Nettle
In the darkness
Round and round
One bite, two bite, three bite, four
In the sunshine
Hear that sound?
Jump up, jump down, jump for the door
In the nursery
Something crawls
Mind the ceiling, mind the floor
In the Garden
Barbed and bright,
Round and round, and round no more
Stinging Nettle
In the darkness
Round and round
One bite, two bite, three bite, four
In the sunshine
Hear that sound?
Jump up, jump down, jump for the door
In the nursery
Something crawls
Mind the ceiling, mind the floor
In the Garden
Barbed and bright,
Round and round, and round no more
