Empress Jessamine herself once offered me a suite at Dunwall Tower, complete with a laboratory and the finest apparatus in the Isles. I declined, of course. I'm not some conjurer from penny novels. Besides, I have a great fondness for my privacy, and my interests often find me coming and going in the odd hours of night.
It's hard not to consider what might have been different, had I plotted a different course through my early years. Was there something I might have said of done when Delilah was my apprentice that could have prevented all this? Or is character a fixed star we must all follow in darkness?
