Tonight, Duke Abele and the others will drink my expensive whiskey and scheme. Jindosh will watch me like a cat with a half-chewed mouse.
Ashworth will sneer about how conventional of the rest of us are. Missing the obvious, she'll flirt for a while then put me in my place.
I'll sit on my anger, remembering what Theodanis meant to me. I'll tell myself I worked for this honor. I swung a pick in the mines, and now the fine folk are guests in my house. If they want to hold a s√©ance, who am I to say it's nonsense?
Whatever happens, I'll regret it. But afterward, Meagan's coming by. Talking with her always sets me right.
