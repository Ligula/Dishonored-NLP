Emanuel,
Halfway up, a cable broke and we lost eleven workers. They never even made it into the mine. Those cables weren't made to carry so many people. You pack enough of them in, even kids, and it adds up.
After that, a sickness spread through the crew bunkhouses. That woman from Addermire, Alexandria Hypatia; she used to treat the workers, but she doesn't come around any more.
So what all this means is that we need more workers.
There are always people coming to Serkonos, looking for a better life. We'll get them into the mines, if I have to club them over the head myself.
